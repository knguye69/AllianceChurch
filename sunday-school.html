    <h2>Sunday School</h2>
    <p>At our Community, we have <em>“Morning Sunday School”</em> from <em>10:30am - 12:00am</em>.
        We divide into 5 different groups according to the age. We have:</p>
    <div id="sunday-school-group">
        <h3>Children group</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Children group from 6 to 10 year of age.</h4>
            <p>In this group, our teachers prepare lessons during the week for every Sunday class.
                The lessons are usually simple and easy to understand for these ages.
                Our lessons are mainly about good example stories and each character names in the story
                so our children will gain knowledge about all the characters including in the Bible and to
                understand clearly about good and bad things in the story. We also expect the children to apply
                what they learn in their daily lives. Besides lecturing, we have fun games and crafts for them
                to create according to the lesson on that day.
                They will have many opportunities to be creative, gain knowledge about the Bible, and makes friends.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Teenager group</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Teenager group from 11 to 15 year of age.</h4>
            <p>A teenager group is special because at this age, our children will be going through some
                phrases in life or we can call it “Puberty”. They will change both physically and mentally.
                Besides, lecturing about Bible, we also have a counselor for them to consider whenever we need and our
                teacher has experienced about dealing with a teenager;
                therefore, our leaders are caring, active listeners, and very patient.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Youth group</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Youth group from 16-30 year of age.</h4>
            <p>In this group, we have a teacher that has a lot of knowledge about the Bible.
                Our teenagers here will have an opportunity to learn more details about characters and their stories
                in the Bible. They will have to memorize weekly Bible Verse and they also have 15-minute quiz every other week.
                They will have time to share with their peers about their lives with ups and downs.
                We have been creating a warm and caring environment for them to feel like a second home.
                Being in this group can help them gain knowledge about the Bible and be specific about good and bad examples
                to apply in their lives, such as in school and at home. We also have a special lesson about
                Marriage at the beginning
                level for them to start realizing how important Marriage is and starts praying for their marriage.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Adult group</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Adult group from 31-49 year of age.</h4>
            <p>This is a group where most of the lessons are focusing on Marriage and we have plenty of time to
                share about Marriage issues and the Pastor will help to give the best advice and try to untangle issues.
                Our Pastor will sort out marriage stories from the Bible to share every Sunday morning.
                The Pastor also shares about his marriage life and gives out good advice for everybody.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Special group</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Special group from 50 and up.</h4>
            <p>For this group, our leader focuses mostly on Bible details and timeline.
                In this class, we expect them to have a good knowledge of all characters, timeline,
                and different stories. Every year, we have a test for this group to complete about Bible verses.
                Other groups can join this test. We also have praying time for their health and their families.
                Some of them might suffer from any illnesses, we encourage everybody in Church to pray for them.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Within an hour, we learn about Bible and share with each other about faith and life. T hese group is very meaningful and
    helpful to grow up and become mature in Chirst. </p>
